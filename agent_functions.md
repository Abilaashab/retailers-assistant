# Agent Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and workflow of the agent system, which consists of a supervisor agent and multiple specialized worker agents. The system is designed to handle natural language queries, process them through appropriate specialized agents, and return meaningful responses.

## System Components

### 1. Supervisor Agent

The supervisor agent acts as the central coordinator of the system. Its primary responsibilities include:

- **Request Reception**: Receives incoming natural language queries from users
- **Intent Classification**: Determines the type of query and which specialized agent should handle it
- **Agent Selection**: Routes the query to the most appropriate worker agent
- **Response Aggregation**: Collects and formats responses from worker agents
- **Error Handling**: Manages errors and fallback mechanisms

### 2. Worker Agents

Specialized agents that handle specific types of queries:

- **Database Query Agent**: Handles data retrieval and analysis queries
- **Personal Assistant Agent**: Manages general conversation and personal assistance tasks
- **Weather Agent**: Provides weather-related information
- **Sales Analysis Agent**: Specialized in sales data analysis

## Workflow

### 1. Query Reception

1. User submits a natural language query
2. The supervisor agent receives the query
3. The query is logged with a timestamp for monitoring and debugging

### 2. Intent Classification

1. The supervisor analyzes the query to determine its intent
2. Classification is done using a combination of:
   - Keyword matching
   - Machine learning models
   - Confidence scoring for each agent type

### 3. Agent Selection

1. Based on the intent classification, the supervisor selects the most appropriate agent
2. If multiple agents could handle the query, the one with the highest confidence score is chosen
3. The query is formatted according to the selected agent's expected input format

### 4. Query Processing

1. The selected worker agent receives the query
2. The agent processes the query using its specialized knowledge and tools
3. For database queries, this may involve:
   - Converting natural language to SQL
   - Executing the query
   - Formatting the results
4. For other agents, this might involve:
   - Calling external APIs
   - Processing data
   - Generating natural language responses

### 5. Response Generation

1. The worker agent formats its response
2. The response includes:
   - The main answer
   - Source data or references
   - Confidence score
   - Any relevant metadata

### 6. Response Delivery

1. The supervisor receives the response from the worker agent
2. The response is formatted for the user interface
3. The response is logged for future reference
4. The response is sent back to the user

## Error Handling

1. If a worker agent fails to process a query:
   - The error is logged
   - The supervisor may try an alternative agent if available
   - A user-friendly error message is returned

2. If the supervisor cannot determine the intent:
   - The user is prompted for clarification
   - Suggestions for rephrasing may be provided

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached to improve response times
- **Timeouts**: Queries that take too long are automatically terminated
- **Load Balancing**: If multiple instances of worker agents are available, the supervisor distributes the load

## Security Considerations

- Input validation is performed on all user queries
- Database queries are parameterized to prevent SQL injection
- Sensitive information is never logged
- API keys and credentials are stored securely

## Monitoring and Logging

- All queries and responses are logged with timestamps
- Performance metrics are collected for each agent
- Error rates and response times are monitored
- Logs are rotated and archived regularly

## Future Enhancements

- Implement learning from user feedback to improve intent classification
- Add support for multi-agent collaboration on complex queries
- Implement conversation history for context-aware responses
- Add support for more specialized worker agents as needed
